# Responsive Portfolio Website Zannatun Vasha.

- I follow this Youtube Video [Watch it on youtube](https://youtu.be/6cidbUHNZRQ)
- I also add some extra feature like if you contact me then your message will come to my email directly. I try that from another youtube video and add that feature in my protfolio.

### Responsive Portfolio Website

A clean and nice web portfolio for designer or developer. That includes almost everything you want to show. At first, your name and a great image. Then the About section displays more information about you. Then the list of skills it offers. It also has a section where it shows some recent work. And at the bottom it has contact information and a form, and at the bottom a footer.
